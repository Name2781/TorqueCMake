<font:Arial Italic:18>Use the scripting language you know and love (or will grow to love)!
<font:Arial:16>TGE uses the same scripting language as other Torque products. If you already use TGB, scripting will be second nature... if this is your first Torque product, the skills you learn will be translatable to other Torque products in the future. TorqueScript syntax is similar to C++, so if you are a C++ programmer, you already have a head start.
